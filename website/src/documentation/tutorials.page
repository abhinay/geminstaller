<pre>
$ gem install geminstaller
   - OR, if you get a permission error -
$ sudo gem install geminstaller 
</pre>

h2(#bootstrapping_your_geminstaller_config). Bootstrapping your GemInstaller Config with the <code>--print-rogue-gems</code> option

You may have no idea what gems your app uses, or you might just want to create a GemInstaller config file with all the gems currently on your system, in order to install the same gems on a different system.  This tutorial will show you how to use the <code>--print-rogue-gems</code> option to automatically create a GemInstaller config file.

<pre>
$ geminstaller --print-rogue-gems > geminstaller.yml
</pre>

That was easy, wasn't it?  This config file should specify the exact versions for all of the gems which are currently installed on your system.

Gotchas/Notes:

# If you generated the file on a unix/mac system with compiled gems and then try to run it on a different platform (like windows) which does not have a compiler, you may get errors.  The "<code>prefer_binary_platform</code> config property":documentation.html#prefer_binary_platform_config_property will try to guess at the correct platform, but if a binary version of the gem does not exist for your platform, or if <code>prefer_binary_platform</code> fails to guess the right platform, you may still fail.
# The <code>--print-rogue-gems</code> option generates *exact* version specifications.  This means that you won't ever get any gem upgrades by running GemInstaller with the standard generated file.  This may be good (an upgrade can never break your app unexpectedly).  However, you may wish to modify some of the version specifications to allow for upgrades.  If you do this, remember to set the "<code>check_for_upgrade</code> config property":documentation.html#check_for_upgrade_config_property to true, but be aware that this will cause GemInstaller to check the remote gem server for upgrades each time it runs, and cause it to run slow or fail if the server is unavailable.

h2(#using_the_autogem_option_to_automatically_require_gems). Using the <code>autogem</code> Option to Automatically Require Gems option

GemInstaller can automatically run the RubyGems 'gem' or 'require_gem' method to automatically add all of the gems in your GemInstaller config file(s) to the load path.  Here's an example.

First, create a simple *<code>geminstaller.yml</code>* file:
<pre>
\---
gems:
- name: ruby-doom
  version: '= 0.8'
</pre>

Now, we'll use <code>irb</code> to test autogem, and verify that it can add the ruby-doom gem to the load path:
<pre>
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> require 'rubygems'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> require 'geminstaller'
=> true
irb(main):003:0> GemInstaller.autogem('--config=geminstaller.yml')
=> autogem returns the gem object(s) as it's return value...
irb(main):004:0> $: # Now verify the gem was added to the load path
=> ["/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ruby-doom-0.8/lib", ...]
</pre>

Note that <code>autogem</code> takes arguments in the same format as the GemInstaller command line and <code>run</code> method, but it ignores arguments which are not applicable (such as -r or -s).  You could also specify no argument at all if you wanted to simply use the default <code>geminstaller.yml</code> file in the current directory.  If you don't want a certain gem to be loaded, you can set the <code>no-autogem</code> property to true for that gem in your config file.

You can also put a call to <code>autogem</code> during your application startup to automatically load all the correct gem versions which are specified by your config file.  See "Integrating GemInstaller into Ruby on Rails":#integrating_geminstaller_into_ruby_on_rails for an example.
