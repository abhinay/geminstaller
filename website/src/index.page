h2. What is GemInstaller?

GemInstaller provides automated management of RubyGems.  It uses a simple YAML config file to:

* Automatically install the correct versions of all required gems wherever your app runs.
* Automatically ensure installed gems and versions are consistent across multiple applications, machines, platforms, and environments 
* Automatically add correct versions of gems to the ruby load path when your app runs ('require_gem'/'gem')
* Automatically reinstall missing dependency gems (built in to RubyGems > 1.0)
* Automatically detect correct platform to install for multi-platform gems (built in to RubyGems > 1.0)
* Print YAML for "rogue gems" which are not specified in the current config, to easily bootstrap your config file, or find gems that were manually installed without GemInstaller.
* Allow for common configs to be reused across projects or environments by supporting multiple config files, including common config file snippets, and defaults with overrides.
* Allow for dynamic selection of gems, versions, and platforms to be used based on environment vars or any other logic.
* Avoid the "works on demo, breaks on production" syndrome

GemInstaller can be used from the command line, or embedded to run automatically on startup for a Rails app or any other Ruby program.

It has been tested on all major platforms (mac, linux, windows), and has an "extensive suite of tests":code/coverage/index.html which are "automatically run by Continuous Integration":http://ci.thewoolleyweb.com against recent versions of RubyGems (0.8.x through 1.0.1).

h2. How do I get it?

GemInstaller can be "downloaded":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1902 from RubyForge.

h2. How do I use it?

See the "Quick Start Guide":documentation/index.html, "Tutorials":documentation/tutorials.html,  or the "Detailed Documentation":documentation/documentation.html.

h2. Who is responsible for GemInstaller?

GemInstaller was created by "Chad Woolley":http://www.thewoolleyweb.com.

h2(#known_issues). Known Issues

Currently, the only _major_ known issue is related to auto-installing the Rails or Mongrel gems via boot.rb or config/preinitializer.rb during startup of Mongrel or Webrick.  This is because the old version is already on the load path before GemInstaller installs the new version.  The simple workaround is to just restart Rails anytime GemInstaller auto-installs a Rails/Mongrel gem upgrade during app startup.  For Rails and other deployable apps, you can also "run GemInstaller from Capistrano":documentation/tutorials.html#running_geminstaller_from_capistrano to avoid this problem in demo/production environments.

There's also some leakage of gem doc warning messages even if you turn down --rubygems-output, but these can be ignored (these same messages can show up when installing gems manually).

I bet there's another bug or twoo, so please "report them if you find them":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=1902!

h2(#history). History

* 0.2.5
** Add 'include_config' directive to yaml config file, allowing other files to be included via ERB.
** Fix broken links in docs - patch from  Maciej Kozak (macio)
* 0.2.4
** Look for config file at config/geminstaller.yml as well as geminstaller.yml
** make startup message ('Installing Gems...') debug level instead of info
** Add custom descriptive error if user gets access permission error when installing a gem
* 0.2.3 - Fix debug statement left in, upgrade rspec, improvements to test suite
* 0.2.2 - Fix performance problems with autogem command (don't manually recurse dependencies, gem method does it already)
* 0.2.1 - RubyGems release 0.9.3 had some major refactoring done to the internals, which broke GemInstaller 0.2.0.  GemInstaller 0.2.1 is a patch release to fix this.  I did limited testing on 0.9.3 and 0.9.0.  Please let me know if anything is broken on any version of RubyGems.
* 0.2.0 - Initial release.  Yay!
