h1. Overview

h2. What is GemInstaller?

GemInstaller provides automated management of RubyGems.  It uses a simple YAML config file to:

* Automatically install the correct versions of all required gems wherever your app runs.
* Automatically ensure installed gems and versions are consistent across multiple applications, machines, platforms, and environments 
* Automatically add correct versions of gems to the ruby load path when your app runs ('require_gem'/'gem')
* Automatically reinstall missing dependency gems
* Automatically guess at correct platform to install for multi-platform gems
* Print YAML for "rogue gems" which are not specified in the current config, to easily bootstrap your config file, or find gems that were manually installed without GemInstaller.
* Avoid the "works on demo, broken on production" syndrome

GemInstaller can be used from the command line, or embedded to run automatically on startup for a Rails app or any other Ruby program.

It has been tested on all major platforms (mac, linux, windows), and recent versions of RubyGems (0.8.x through 0.9.x).

h2. Known Bugs

Currently (version 0.0.2), the only _major_ known bug is related to auto-installing the Rails or Mongrel gems via boot.rb during startup of Mongrel or Webrick.  The simple workaround is to just restart Rails anytime GemInstaller auto-installs a Rails/Mongrel gem upgrade during app startup.  Researching and fixing this problem is a top priority.  I bet there's another bug or twoo, so please "report them if you find them":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=1902!
