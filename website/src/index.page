h1. Overview

h2. What is GemInstaller?

GemInstaller provides automated management of RubyGems.  It uses a simple YAML config file to:

* Automatically install the correct versions of all required gems wherever your app runs.
* Automatically ensure installed gems and versions are consistent across multiple applications, machines, platforms, and environments 
* Automatically add correct versions of gems to the ruby load path when your app runs ('require_gem'/'gem')
* Automatically reinstall missing dependency gems
* Automatically guess at correct platform to install for multi-platform gems
* Print YAML for "rogue gems" which are not specified in the current config, to easily bootstrap your config file, or find gems that were manually installed without GemInstaller.
* Allow for common configs to be reused across projects or environments by supporting multiple config files and defaults with overrides.
* Avoid the "works on demo, breaks on production" syndrome

GemInstaller can be used from the command line, or embedded to run automatically on startup for a Rails app or any other Ruby program.

It has been tested on all major platforms (mac, linux, windows), and recent versions of RubyGems (0.8.x through 0.9.4).

h2. How do I get it?

GemInstaller can be "downloaded":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1902 from RubyForge.

h2. How do I use it?

See the "Quick Start Guide":documentation/index.html, "Tutorials":documentation/tutorials.html,  or the "Detailed Documentation":documentation/documentation.html.

h2. Who is responsible for GemInstaller?

GemInstaller was created by "Chad Woolley":http://www.thewoolleyweb.com.

h2(#known_bugs). Known Bugs

Currently (as of version 0.2.3), the only _major_ known bug is related to auto-installing the Rails or Mongrel gems via boot.rb during startup of Mongrel or Webrick.  The simple workaround is to run GemInstaller manually or just restart Rails anytime GemInstaller auto-installs a Rails/Mongrel gem upgrade during app startup.  For Rails and other deployable apps, you can also "run GemInstaller from Capistrano":documentation/tutorials.html#running_geminstaller_from_capistrano to avoid this problem in demo/production environments.  Researching and fixing this problem is a top priority.  I bet there's another bug or twoo, so please "report them if you find them":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=1902!

There's also some leakage of gem doc warning messages even if you turn down --rubygems-output, but these can be ignored (these same messages show up when installing gems manually).  This should be fixed soon.

h2(#history). History

* 0.2.3 - Fix debug statement left in, upgrade rspec, improvements to test suite
* 0.2.2 - Fix performance problems with autogem command (don't manually recurse dependencies, gem method does it already)
* 0.2.1 - RubyGems release 0.9.3 had some major refactoring done to the internals, which broke GemInstaller 0.2.0.  GemInstaller 0.2.1 is a patch release to fix this.  I did limited testing on 0.9.3 and 0.9.0.  Please let me know if anything is broken on any version of RubyGems.
* 0.2.0 - Initial release.  Yay!
