h2. What is GemInstaller?

GemInstaller provides automated management of RubyGems.  It uses a simple YAML config file to:

* Automatically install the correct versions of all required gems wherever your app runs.
* Automatically ensure installed gems and versions are consistent across multiple applications, machines, platforms, and environments 
* Automatically add correct versions of gems to the ruby load path when your app runs ('require_gem'/'gem')
* Automatically reinstall missing dependency gems (built in to RubyGems > 1.0)
* Automatically detect correct platform to install for multi-platform gems (built in to RubyGems > 1.0)
* Print YAML for "rogue gems" which are not specified in the current config, to easily bootstrap your config file, or find gems that were manually installed without GemInstaller.
* Allow for common configs to be reused across projects or environments by supporting multiple config files, including common config file snippets, and defaults with overrides.
* Allow for dynamic selection of gems, versions, and platforms to be used based on environment vars or any other logic.
* Avoid the "works on demo, breaks on production" syndrome

GemInstaller can be used from the command line, or embedded to run automatically on startup for a Rails app or any other Ruby program.

It has been tested on all major platforms (mac, linux, windows), and has an "extensive suite of tests":code/coverage/index.html which are "automatically run by Continuous Integration":http://ci.thewoolleyweb.com against recent versions of RubyGems (> 1.0.1 releases and trunk)..

h2. How do I get it?

GemInstaller can be "downloaded":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1902 from RubyForge.

h2. How do I use it?

See the "Quick Start Guide":documentation/index.html, "Tutorials":documentation/tutorials.html,  or the "Detailed Documentation":documentation/documentation.html.

h2. Who is responsible for GemInstaller?

GemInstaller was created by "Chad Woolley":http://www.thewoolleyweb.com.

h2. Why not just use Rails' config.gems?

GemInstaller "has some advantages":faq.html#rails_config_gems over Rails' config.gems.

** deprecate support of rubygems 0.9.5, 1.0.0, and 1.1.0.
** Change handling of platforms on rubygems on Rubygems > 0.9.5, let RubyGems handle default.
** Rename GemInstaller.run method to GemInstaller.install, keep 'run' as an alias for 'install'
** Include instructions ‍to‍ run‍ geminstaller‍ to‍ install‍ the‍ missing‍ version  when‍ gem‍ version‍ error‍ is‍ detected.
** Rubygems‍ 1.x ‍compatibility.
** Better internal support for uninstall options.
** Use‍ new,‍ correct‍ x86-mswin32‍ format‍ for‍ mswin32‍ platform‍ gems.
** Update‍ warning‍ message‍ for‍ older‍ rubygems‍ versions.
** Made tests run on Mac OS X Leopard w/RubyGems 1.0.1.
* 0.3.0
** Changes to work with RubyGems >= 0.9.5 and take advantage of new platform and auto-install features.  See "notes on RubyGems version compatibility":code/index.html#rubygems_compatibility
** On Linux/Mac, you can now specify a RUBYGEMS_VERSION environment var to test against a specific version of RubyGems.
** Improved smoketest.rb and autogem_test.rb
** Tests now run on windows (only against latest rubygems, with it installed, and only via test/test_all.rb, not rake)
** deprecated/disabled prefer_binary_platform
