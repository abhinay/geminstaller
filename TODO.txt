=============== Unfiled =============
* release with support for rubygems >= 0.9.5
================ 0.3.0 release ===================
* turn smoketest into rake task, with correct return code handling, and hook up to cruise
* look into and explain mongrel/webrick installation errors
* add top-level method for uninstall of gems, and document (requested by Alex Chaffee and others)
* Rename API: deprecate 'autogem' and rename to 'load'; change current 'run' to 'install'; add new 'run' which automatically calls both 'install' and 'load', add 'no-load' option (only applicable when invoked programatically) to supress automatic 'load'

* docs - add example of using environment variable to control gem version without changing code (Rails)
* docs - document and add sample file for preinitializer boot hook.  Explain why it can't be in environment.rb vs boot.rb or prinitializer (bottom line: env is not processed before Initializer, so can't be used to load rails gems)
* tutorial: using common or shared config files, with different configs for different environments - test (rspec) vs. dev (capistrano) vs. demo/staging/prod, mention include_config option and pros/cons of different approaches
* docs - rename "Documentation" page to "Manual"
* rogue gems config generation - add warning and instructions for cleaning up auto-generated file.  For example, deleting rails dependencies
* faq - mention 'cannot load error' from load, and why it happens (rubygems can only load one version)
* faq - mention tradeoffs of optimistic version requirement (>=) vs pessimistic (=), specifically how mongrel specifies its dependencies
* put mongrel/rails startup bug in tracker, add link in "known bugs" section on home page.
* tutorial: running via capistrano
* crossreference front page, tutorials, and docs
================ 0.3.1 release ===================
* Namespace remaining un-namespaced constants
* Allow array or eval'able string of gems to be passed as --gems arg or instead of args
* Add @options[:gems], should be parsed from command line* root-owned gems: add -S | --sudo-only-if-allowed option, will only invoke sudo if GEMINSTALLER_ALLOW(S)_SUDO env var is set
* root-owned gems: add automatic re-invoke with sudo option (with warning message) if permission error is caught
* root-owned gems: Dynamically detect posix platform and check if gem repo is completely writeable.  Ignorable prompt?
* docs - clean up sudo section.  Should be clearer about sudoers entry, and make sure that NOPASSWD is the last entry.  Rename from #dealing_with_sudo to #dealing_with_root_owned_gems, rewrite to reflect new best practices (different GEM_PATH or auto-sudo via capistrano)
* tutorial: update running via capistrano to reference new sudo docs
================ 0.3.2 release ===================
* handle installation of gem from file (requested by Alex Chaffee)
* Investigate gem_plugin.  Plugin for mongrel???
* Investigate making a Rails plugin
================ 0.3.3 release ===================
* Why does RubyGems reinstall BlueCloth even though it is already installed?!?!? (remove from FAQ after solved)
* Figure out how to suppress webrick messages from embedded gem server
* add option to warn if any rogue gems are found
================ 0.3.4 release =====================
================ 0.3.5 finishing website ===================
* autogem and run args can be passed as string or array
* better test coverage for --sudo and --exception options
* use rspec context_setup
* split out geminstaller_spec into application_spec and geminstaller_spec.  Fix reference in docs / design
* newlines printed between dots when "updating" message is included in error message
* Error on activerecord for brand-new rubygems installation - couldn't find gem.  Did a gem list --remote activerecord, then it went away (got sudo error), then happened again, then worked when I passed -gall -rall options.
* Fastthread = only shows version 0.6.2 on windows, rubygems 0.9 ???
* geminstaller_spec autogem spec must have the GemRunner "initialized" or else the stub gem in test_gem_home won't be found by autogem.
* fix_dependencies=true takes FOREVER on windows
* echo stdin, lists presented for debug output levels
* Just ignore sudo option on windows, rather than throwing an error
* why does windows try to reinstall fxruby 1.6.6 when it is already installed???
* Figure out how to avoid checking dependency gems multiple times if multiple dependent gems depend on them.
* write coverage_no_platform_specific rake task (to get 100% coverage on a mac)
* On rogue gems, allow configuration of gems which are auto-installed and/or should be ignored.
* add option to print rogue gems with no extra output, for concatenation to existing gem list
* Research what all existing gem platforms are.  See if they can all be covered in valid_platform_selector
* Can GemInstaller handle multiple gem server sources via multiple config files?
* Handle default gems that come with ruby/rubygems windows distro. 
* refactor enhanced_stream_ui.ask_yes_no - does it need to catch the exception?  Also review context name (no OutputProxy) and use of StringIO, and exception tests.
* rename enhanced_stream_ui to noninteractive_stream_ug
* add multilevel dependency smoketests for autogem (old rails version)
* refactor duplication in autogem/rogue_gem_finder using blocks
* rubygems stdout - don't print prefix for single dot
* clean up regexps - no leading or trailing .*
* Return meaningful message instructing to use the --sudo option if Errno::EACCES is caught on a sudo-able platform - should throw GemInstaller::AccessException, which can be caught
* Rails integration doesn't work under mongrel when invoked via executable (e.g, actionmailer gem not recognized after install, only after mongrel restart).  Does't occur under webrick, or if geminstaller is invoked programatically via class.
* rails example doesn't print any warning if geminstaller is not installed
* "Installing gem" messages are duplicated if info message is specified, one from rubygems, one from geminstaller.  See todo in install_processor.rb
* boot.rb parsed twice under webrick?
* commandecho doesn't print regexps correctly
* code coverage for logic paths supporting old rubygems versions
* spec_utils - use extend+include ClassAndInstanceMethods approach
* clean up registry - third-party first, no dependency next, alphabetized
* review/clean up ri/rdoc
* Better errors for invalid yaml (unsupported keys)
========= 0.3.0 release ==============
* patch hoe to install_gem without sudo on windows
* understand why '> 1' must be quoted to be a valid yaml value - see yaml_loader_spec.rb
* tests failed when "partially" connected to network? (wireless at office)
* tests fail with timeouts intermittently on windows
* add more tests for dependencies to geminstaller_spec
* reconcile methods for testing error messages - manually vs proc_should_raise_with_message.  Probably should patch rspec.
* remove test_gem_home.reset from geminstaller_spec.rb WITHOUT breaking the test suite.
* tests fail on windows - seems to be related to test_gem_home running twice.  smoketest still passes.
* can't run binary out of source dir unless running it via ruby
* running binary via ruby out of bin dir will pick up gem first on load path if it is installed
* verify that >= version spec works with a specific platform, if that platform is not available for the highest version
* Check for write access, and exit with warning to use sudo if there is no write access.
* store rubygems dist as a tar, and untar it on demand
* Add spec file name to all contexts (or see if rspec can do it automatically)
* Embedded gem_server process doesn't get killed on windows during tests - need to use ruby services, see comment in embedded_gem_server.rb
* Embedded gem_server ports aren't handled correctly on linux during tests - port conflict on startup, open ports die off slowly after tests finish
* Do a port check before starting embedded gem server, give option to kill process or at least exit with a descriptive warning.
* remove cruft from test output - intercept output streams from gem_server and rubygems setup
* enhance DependencyInjector - allow items to be substituted prior to initialization - then geminstaller_spec could simply set a mock output_proxy on the registry instead of explicitly setting it every place it is used.
* ensure --debug install option works as expected
* fix all Zentest warnings
* Rename RubyGem class to RubyGemAction (or maybe RubyGemDependency to match 1.x)
* Automate process for creating a stubgem
* Give nice error message if gem server is unavailable (check socket)
* Make tests run under RadRails debugger
* handle unsupported gem install options - for example, -t gives uninitialized constant Gem::Validator
* update info in stubgem (not sow defaults)
* Fix errors when using relative or ~/ dir in --config path
* make verbose option specify --backtrace on all gem commands
* Add support, syntax, and options for uninstalling gems - completely, or down to highest specified version.
* add feature to automatically warn if there is a more recent version of the gem available and check_for_upgrade == false.  Use "gem outdated" command
