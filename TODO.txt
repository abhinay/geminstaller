* decide how to deal with sudo problem.  probably initially just tell people to add user and gem command to sudoers file with no password
* take alternate file location as parameter
* take --trace parameter to show full stack trace
* write basic rdoc instructions
* test and write docs about how to hook into rails
* Test rest of rakefile tasks - docs, rcov, site publish
* publish site
* upload gem 
* create basic website
* fix functional test - automate local gem server startup
