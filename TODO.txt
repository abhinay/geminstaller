* Handle multiplatform gem which has a dependency on another multiplatform gem which has a dependency on...
* Check for write access, and exit with warning to use sudo if there is no write access.
* Add docs about using sudo to README.txt.
* Handle gems with "CURRENT" platform
* Make sure specifications with '~' are handled correctly
* non-specific versions in config yml (such as > 0.1.2) must be specified in quotes (such as '> 0.1.2') or else they are not correctly parsed by yaml (just returns '0.1.2' instead of '> 0.1.2').  Should give some warning instead of just failing
* Add spec file name to all contexts (or see if rspec can do it automatically)
* Make GemInstaller.run take a parameter to not fail if there is any error
* Embedded gem_server process doesn't get killed on windows during tests
* Embedded gem_server ports aren't handled correctly on linux during tests - port conflict on startup, open ports die off slowly after tests finish
* Do a port check before starting embedded gem server, give option to kill process or at least exit with a descriptive warning.
* Add additional dependencies and versions in Hoe, add dependency on Hoe, RubyForge
* rake test fails on linux (problems starting embedded gem server)
* write basic rdoc instructions
* publish site
* upload gem 
* Define procedure to invoke programatically via rails and non-rails
* Document simple example (command line, rails, non-rails) in README.txt
* create basic website
* Clean up spec_helper, find out simplest way to invoke rspec via test_unit, and still provide proper return codes/output
* Application should not do any remote operations (or anything, really) if the version and platform are non-ambiguous and already installed.
* get 100% code coverage
* ensure --debug install option works as expected
* Rename local_gem_server to embedded_gem_server
* remove cruft from test output
* Remove hoe as a dependency for stubgems
* Use a logger, hook it into --info/verbose option
* add more output for --info option.  Should also be able to check info flag from classes other than Application
* rename is_gem_installed to is_gem_installed?
* fix all Zentest warnings
* Rename RubyGem class to RubyGemAction, add install vs. uninstall actions in config (install is default)
* Automate process for creating a stubgem
* Look into using RubyGems built in dependency support rather than home-grown solution
* Give nice error message if gem server is unavailable (check socket)
* Make tests run under RadRails debugger
* Rename GemInstaller::Runner to GemInstaller::GemInstaller
* handle unsupported gem install options - for example, -t gives uninitialized constant Gem::Validator
* update info in stubgem (not sow defaults)
* Make SourceIndex.search use alternate method that does exact regex match, to avoid passing the exact regex ourselves.
* Fix errors when using relative or ~/ dir in --config path
* add option to specify --backtrace on all gem commands
* Add support, syntax, and options for uninstalling gems - completely, or down to highest specified version.
* Review and clarify meanings of --info, --verbose, and --trace (logging vs. stacktraces vs. ???)
* add feature to automatically warn if there is a more recent version of the gem available and check_for_upgrade == false.
* auto-generate geminstaller.yml files (possibly by parsing source)
